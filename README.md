# sveltype

A project for testing out Svelte by implementing a touch type tutor.  
For setup please refer to [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps and  https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

I'ts alive under http://www.dijkmeijer.com<br/>

This project is inspired by [Hotcold] (https://github.com/palerdot/hotcold) but tries be modular.  
Sveltype is my first Svelte project, so please be kind the chosen solution is "sub optimal".
