Nature shows us only the tail of the lion. But there is no doubt in my mind that the lion belongs with it even if he cannot reveal himself to the eye all at once because of his huge dimension. How does it happen that a properly endowed natural scientist comes to concern himself with epistemology? Concepts that have proven useful in ordering things easily achieve such authority over us that we forget their earthly origins and accept them as unalterable givens. 'How much do I love that noble man More than I could tell with words I fear though he'll remain alone With a holy halo of his own.' Subtle is the Lord, but malicious He is not. I have second thoughts. Maybe God is malicious. In science, moreover, the work of the individual is so bound up with that of his scientific predecessors and contemporaries that it appears almost as an impersonal product of his generation. [I do not] carry such information in my mind since it is readily available in books....The value of a college education is not the learning of many facts but the training of the mind to think. I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice. As I have said so many times, God doesn't play dice with the world. Whether you can observe a thing or not depends on the theory which you use. It is the theory which decides what can be observed."

Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion. To that extent I am, in point of fact, religious. I believe in Spinoza's God, Who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God Who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of mankind. If A is success in life, then A = x + y + z. Work is x, play is y and z is keeping your mouth shut. Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving. I believe that whatever we do or live for has its causality; it is good, however, that we cannot see through to it. To punish me for my contempt of authority, Fate has made me an authority myself. I never think of the future. It comes soon enough. It is my view that a vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind. Why does this magnificent applied science which saves work and makes life easier bring us so little happiness? The simple answer runs: Because we have not yet learned to make sensible use of it. I believe in intuition and inspiration. … At times I feel certain I am right while not knowing the reason. When the eclipse of 1919 confirmed my intuition, I was not in the least surprised. In fact I would have been astonished had it turned out otherwise. Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution. It is, strictly speaking, a real factor in scientific research."

I see a clock, but I cannot envision the clockmaker. The human mind is unable to conceive of the four dimensions, so how can it conceive of a God, before whom a thousand years and a thousand dimensions are as one ? Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile. Our experience hitherto justifies us in trusting that nature is the realization of the simplest that is mathematically conceivable. It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience. Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler. All of science is nothing more than the refinement of everyday thinking. One may say 'the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility. All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree. All these aspirations are directed toward ennobling man's life, lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual towards freedom. Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world. Still, there are moments when one feels free from one's own identification with human limitations and inadequacies. At such moments, one imagines that one stands on some spot of a small planet, gazing in amazement at the cold yet profoundly moving beauty of the eternal, the unfathomable: life and death flow into one, and there is neither evolution nor destiny; only being'."
